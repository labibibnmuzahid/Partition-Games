# Partition Games

A comprehensive web application featuring **12 combinatorial partition games**, built to support research in combinatorial game theory at **Rhodes College**.

Developed under the **Rhodes College Summer Fellowship '25** by [Soumitro](mailto:dwiso-28@rhodes.edu) and [Aayan](mailto:debaa-28@rhodes.edu), supervised by [Prof. Eric Gottlieb](https://www.rhodes.edu/bio/eric-gottlieb). LLM models (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) were used to craft and modify some parts of the project under the supervision of the developers.

If you find any bug or want to learn more, please reach out to us.

## Available Games

### Impartial Games

| Game | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **LCTR** (Left Column Top Row) | Remove the leftmost column or the top row. Classic impartial game with Sprague-Grundy AI. |
| **CRIM** (Column Row Immediate Merge) | Remove any row or column; divided parts merge after each move. |
| **CRIS** (Column Row Independent Splits) | Same moves as CRIM, but fragments remain independent. |
| **Sato-Welter** | Remove a hook shape (upside-down L) from any square, eliminating all squares to the right and below. |
| **RIT** (Row Inequality Theorem) | Remove cells from a row if it has equal or more cells than the row below. |
| **Corner** | Remove random subsets of corner pieces from uniform partitions. |
| **AntiCorner** | Sato-Welter style moves targeting anti-corner positions. |
| **Continuous Corner** | Select consecutive ranges of corner pieces. |
| **CRIT** (Column Row Inequality Theorem) | Enhanced RIT with both row and column comparison moves. |
| **SCC** (Strict Continuous Corner) | Must begin with topmost or bottommost corner; sequential subset selection. |

### Partizan Games

| Game | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **CRPM** (Column Row Partizan Merge) | Player A removes rows, Player B removes columns. Partizan version of CRIM. |
| **CRPS** (Column Row Partizan Splits) | Player A controls rows, Player B controls columns in fragment partitions. |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for multiplayer server)

### Running Locally

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/labibibnmuzahid/Partition-Games.git
cd Partition-Games
```

**2. For single-player games:**

Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or start a local server:

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Node.js
npx serve .
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

**3. For multiplayer functionality:**

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

## Multiplayer

Real-time competitive play powered by WebSocket connections.

- **Room-based matching** with shareable room codes
- **Cross-platform** — play on any device
- **Synchronized game state** with automatic reconnection
- **Spectator mode** for observing matches

**How to play:**
1. Navigate to the multiplayer landing page
2. Create a new room or join with a room code
3. Share the code with your opponent
4. Play once both players have joined

Currently available for **Corner** and **LCTR** games.
